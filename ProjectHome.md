# Advanced webcrawler #

## what it does ##
when doing a pentest you might need to go through all links of a webpage (same domain or multiple subdomains) and creates simple text outpupt files where you can analyse the content of the page for security relevant comments, forms, variables etc. Tools like ZAP, burpsuite etc. are all great - but when it comes to sort the output of a session they might have certain limits. Anyway: this is more like an information gathering tool. The actual vulnerability scanning is in a testing phase and needs to be improved. Feedback/improvements welcome :-)

This Tool written in delphi initially acts as a crawler that will spider all web pages and analyses them. You have the ability to extract predifined informations (external links, external hosts, mail adresses, comments, files etc.) or custom queries from all pages within a domain or even multiple subdomains.

Additionally this tool has a strong vulnerability testing engine which will discover XSS and SQL Injection flaws.


## Installation ##
Just extract all files to the same directory and run the exe. No installation required. The licence file is icluded.

## Download ##
You can download the source by clicking on "Source". Then navigate to "browse". Then navigate to the correct tree (most times its trunk". On the right side you will find the files. If you wan't to download e.g. an already comiled exe you can click on the "exe" in the right window. It will tell you that the file is too big to display. But on the left side you can still see a link "view raw file". Right mouse click on that and "save as". you will then be able to save the exe.
